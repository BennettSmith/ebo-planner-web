# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on Keep a Changelog, and this project adheres to Semantic Versioning.

This repository contains the member-facing web application for interacting with the Overland Trip Planning service.
The API contract and behavior are defined in the spec repository; this changelog focuses on user-visible web UX and deployment impact.

The OpenAPI inputs this web app consumes are vendored under `openapi/`; generated TypeScript types live under `functions/_generated/`.

Notes:

- Spec changelog = contract & behavior
- Web changelog = UX, pages, auth/session behavior, and any user-facing changes
